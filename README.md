# Machine-Learning-in-Deep-Space-Detecting-Exoplanets-from-Stellar-Light

This project focuses on applying AI and machine learning techniques to analyze time series data from the Kepler space telescope to detect exoplanets. The dataset contains flux measurements of thousands of stars, each labeled to indicate the presence of exoplanets. Using advanced ML algorithms, the goal is to create a model that accurately distinguishes between stars with confirmed exoplanets and those without, based on the periodic changes in light intensity over time. By leveraging AI to process and analyze this extensive dataset, the project aims to improve the accuracy of exoplanet detection and contribute to the search for new worlds beyond our solar system.
